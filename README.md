## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Gulp.js] (https://gulpjs.com/)
- JavaScript


### What I learned

First I tried to use CSS Grid on the body element to set up the flow of the element but it didn't work as I imagined it would work so I decided to just not use anything on the body it was easier that way. I used CSS Grid on the Header element. On everything else I used FlexBox. instead of using Input type submit on form element I instead used a element because I couldn't figure out how to setup :hover on submit. I used Bootstrap icons for socials because I didn't get the images on downloading the challenge but couldn't figured out how to set up changing color on them while hovering.
